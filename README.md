# MyReads Project
Welcom to MyReads, Where you can keep track of your fav books 

## Instalation 

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## How to use

You can Search for books by author or title.
Can add book to read, currently reading, want to read categories by select categorie from bropdown provided for each book.


## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
